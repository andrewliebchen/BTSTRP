# What is BTSTRP?

BTSTRP is the smallest UI framework out there...Literally the smallest. BTSTRP has all the same basic components as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), but they're just tiny. Best of all, it uses the same markup structure as Bootstrap.

## Getting started

Download or clone this repo. If your project uses Sass, you can import `btstrp.scss` into your project or just include `btstrp.css` in your site's `<head>`. If you're using vanilla CSS, just include `btstrp.css` in your site's `<head>`.

You can also install BTSTRP in your project with npm or Bower. Instructions.

### Working on BTSTRP locally

If you want to contribute to BTSTRP, or just work on it for yourself, you should fork and clone this repo. From your local BTSTRP directory run:

```
$ npm install
```

Grunt is set up to compile the SCSS into CSS, watch for changes, and spin up a development server.

```
$ grunt
```

## Using BTSTRP in your project

Most Bootstrap features and components are available in BTSTRP. A few features are excluded because they're not necessary at BTSTRP's small scale. For example, there is only one button size, and no responsive elements. For reference, you should refer to the excellent [Bootstrap documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).

Here's a list of **excluded** elements:
* **Grid system** Media queries
* **Code** Inline code, user input, blocks of code, variables, and sample output
* **Tables** Responsive tables
* **Forms** Control sizing
* **Buttons** Sizes and link button
* **Images** Responsive images
* **Helper classes** Screen reader content, and image replacement
* **Responsive utilities** Classes, print classes, and test cases
* **Glyphicons**
* **Button groups** Sizing and vertical variation
* **Button dropdowns** Sizing
* **Input groups** Sizing
* **Navbar** Responsive elements
* **Alerts** Dismissible alerts
* **Responsive embed**
* **Carousels**

### The BTSTRP container

Wrap your BTSTRP thumbnails in the `.btstrp-container` element like so:

```
<div class="btstrp-container">
  <!-- thumnbail markup -->
</div>
```

If you'd like your container to have browser style, add `.btstrp-browser`.

```
<div class="btstrp-container btstrp-browser">
  <!-- thumbnail markup -->
</div>
```

### Font

Typography in BTSTRP thumbnails is brought to you by the excellent [BLOKK font](http://blokkfont.com/).

## Why is this useful?

BTSTRP is intended for creating thumbnails of UIs and user flows for websites and applications. You can create a series of zoomed-out, "20,000 foot" interactive view of your site, which at a glance tell a whole story, like the page from a comic book.
